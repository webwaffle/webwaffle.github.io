        <p>Vue is an open source Javascript framework. It's kind of like Angular and React.</p>
        <h2>Reason 1: It's easy</h2>
        <p>Vue is incredibly easy to get started with. The official guide gets you using components with props in like an hour! Also, once you are proficient in Vue, it is easy and doesn't take a lot of time to create web apps.</p>
        <h2>Reason 2: You can implement it anywhere</h2>
        <p>You can implement it from Node with something like Webpack or Browserify, you can use single-file components, you can put it in an Electron desktop app, there's even a Nativescript plugin for Vue mobile app development. Or, you can just use it in the browser with a good old script tag, which lets you use any server side language (or none at all.) React and Angular are a lot harder to create a project with.</p>
        <h2>Reason 3: All the side projects</h2>
        <p>Vuex, Vue Router, and more are projects that build on Vue, making it even more powerful than it already is.</p>
        <h2>Reason 4: It's Powerful</h2>
        <p>So much of what you can do in Angular and React you can do easier in Vue. Components, props, you name it.</p>
