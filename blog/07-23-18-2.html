        <h1>Editor Showdown</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The editors we will be looking at are Sublime Text, Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, and Atom.</p>
        <h2>Sublime Text</h2>
        <p>Sublime Text is a great editor. It costs money, but the free trial lasts forever. It has lots of features and is a good all-around code editor.</p>
        <h2>Notepad++</h2>
        <p>Notepad++ is an oldie but a goodie. It is incredibly lightweight. It has support for a ton of languages. The only drawback is the dated interface.</p>
        <h2>VS Code</h2>
        <p>I KNOW it's made by Microsoft, but it's still free and awesome. It has a built in terminal, which is nice. It has lots and lots of extensions and themes, so you can customize it however you want.</p>
        <h2>Atom</h2>
        <p>Made by Github, Atom is an editor that uses a ton of RAM. In my opinion, it's worth it. It lets you modify a stylesheet to customize how it looks. It also has lots of extensions and themes, one of which is called Teletype. Teletype lets you collaborate on code in real time (Like Google Docs). </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I personally like (and use) VS Code and Atom. All of these are great editors, so take your pick.</p>
